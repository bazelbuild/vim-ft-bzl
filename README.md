A rudimentary [Bazel](http://bazel.io) filetype plugin. Provides syntax files
and basic settings for the bzl filetype and detection rules for bzl files.

**NOTE**: Most of these files have been merged into vim's upstream runtime
files. You usually don't need this plugin unless you're running an older version
of vim, or want to receive updates before they're merged into vim.
